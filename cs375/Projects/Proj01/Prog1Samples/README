Gertrude20.txt is the Price List file for Market File MarketPrice20.txt
Gertrude21.txt is the Price List file for Market File MarketPrice21.txt
Gertrude22.txt is the Price List file for Market File MarketPrice22.txt
GertrudeThree.txt is the Price List file for Market File MarketPriceThree.txt

Each of the first three sample tests has one problem per Price List file.
The 4th sample test has all four problems in a single Price List file.

Your program should write to output file output.txt. The contents of output.txt
has been copied to Output21.txt, Output22.txt, Output23.txt, and OutputThree.txt.

Timing information has been replaced by 0.0 for all tests.  Your program will
begin to take a measurable amount of time for problem sizes similar to those
included in this test.
